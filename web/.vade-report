# Vercel Web Analytics Implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented Vercel Web Analytics for the 5G RRC States Next.js application using the `@vercel/analytics` package for Next.js App Router.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added @vercel/analytics Package
- Installed `@vercel/analytics@^1.6.1` as a production dependency
- Updated `package.json` and `package-lock.json` with the new dependency

### 2. Modified Root Layout (src/app/layout.tsx)
- Added import statement: `import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/next"`
- Added `<Analytics />` component at the end of the `<body>` tag, after `{children}`
- This follows the official Next.js App Router pattern for Vercel Web Analytics

## Implementation Details

The Analytics component was placed at the bottom of the body tag (after children) to:
- Ensure it doesn't block the main content rendering
- Follow Vercel's recommended best practices for Next.js App Router
- Enable automatic route change detection and page view tracking

## Testing & Verification

✅ Successfully ran `npm run build` - production build completed without errors
✅ Successfully ran `npm run lint` - no ESLint warnings or errors
✅ All routes built successfully (/, /_not-found, /study)
✅ No TypeScript type errors

## Next Steps for Deployment

Once deployed to Vercel:
1. Enable Web Analytics in the Vercel Dashboard (Project → Analytics → Enable)
2. Deploy the application using `vercel deploy` or via Git integration
3. Verify analytics are working by checking for `/_vercel/insights/view` requests in browser Network tab
4. View analytics data in the Vercel Dashboard under the Analytics tab

## Files Modified
- `web/src/app/layout.tsx` - Added Analytics component import and usage
- `web/package.json` - Added @vercel/analytics dependency
- `web/package-lock.json` - Updated with new dependency tree

## Technical Notes
- Using Next.js 14.2.35 with App Router architecture
- Analytics component automatically handles route changes and page views
- No additional configuration needed for basic analytics tracking
- The implementation is TypeScript-compatible and type-safe

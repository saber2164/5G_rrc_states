## Implementation Details

The implementation follows the official Vercel Web Analytics setup for Next.js App Router:
- The `Analytics` component is a wrapper around the tracking script
- Provides seamless integration with Next.js including automatic route support
- Placed at the end of the body tag to avoid blocking page rendering
- Will automatically start tracking visitors and page views once deployed to Vercel

## Verification

✅ Linting passed with no errors or warnings
✅ Build completed successfully
✅ No TypeScript errors
✅ All existing functionality preserved

## Next Steps

Once deployed to Vercel:
1. Enable Web Analytics in the Vercel dashboard (Analytics tab of your project)
2. Visitors and page views will automatically be tracked
3. Verify setup by checking for `/_vercel/insights/view` requests in browser Network tab
4. View analytics data in the Vercel dashboard after deployment

## Notes

- The Analytics component requires no additional configuration for basic tracking
- Custom events can be added later if needed for tracking specific user interactions
- Privacy-compliant and GDPR-friendly by default
